# Privacy Policy for Better Browsing for Crunchyroll

Last updated: November 7, 2024

## What Data We Collect
The extension only reads and modifies content on Crunchyroll.com website pages, specifically:
- Anime titles
- Rating numbers
- Page structure for sorting purposes

## Data Storage
The only data we store are user preferences:
- Rating display setting (on/off)
- Sorting setting (on/off)

These preferences are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API and are not transmitted anywhere.

## Data Usage
- All content manipulation happens locally in your browser
- No data is collected, transmitted, or shared with any third parties
- No personal information is collected
- No analytics or tracking is implemented

## Your Rights
Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no personal data to manage. Your preference settings can be changed or reset at any time through the extension options.

## Changes to This Policy
If we update this privacy policy, we will publish the new version with the extension update.
